\abstractEN{
My work explores the relationship between the Military-Industrial Complex and life as performance. With influences as diverse as Rousseau and John Cage, new combinations are created from both opaque and transparent discourse. 
As temporal derivatives become transformed through emergent and repetitive practice, the viewer is left with an epitaph for the darkness of our existence.
